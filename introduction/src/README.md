# About

This repository serves as a playground and learning base for C++. I usually explore features and possibilities and different features of the language, albeit not in the most efficient or suitable way.
I'm using a Linux Debian 11 system and g++ to compile the source codes in the following version (output from `g++ --version`):

`g++ (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110`

Currently using the C++14 version based on the `__cplusplus` macro.
