# About

This is the whole program for the same asa in student_grades_basic and student_grades_struct files. It's split into different header files with sample calculations of a final student grade.

# Run

Compile and run programs either manually or through an IDE.

## Grading

This program provides a makefile to make it easier to build and run. Compile and run the makefile in terminal:

```sh
$ make build
```

This creates the final executable called `grading`. To clean the executable either remove it manually or call `make clean`.
