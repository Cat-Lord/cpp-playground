# About

This is the whole program for the same asa in student_grades_basic and student_grades_struct files. It's split into different header files with sample calculations of a final student grade.

# Run

Compile and run the makefile in terminal:

```sh
$ make build
```

This creates the final executable called `grading`. To clean the executable either remove it manually or call `make clean`.
